# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Inspiration for the game comes from playing Tic Tac Toe as a kid with my siblings.
The controls work by clicking on one of the 9 boxes. An X or an O will appear depending on whose turn it is
You play the game by trying to get 3 in a row ether vertically, horizontally or diagonally. If an X or an O is displayed consecutively three times, then the corresponding player wins.
Technologies used to build the game include: videos from youtube, files from previous courses in the SDSU bootcamp.
This is a game designed for playing Tic Tac Toe with two people.
The HTML and CSS will be designed in order to settup the game.
The game_logic.js file will be designed in order to make the game run and operate properly.
